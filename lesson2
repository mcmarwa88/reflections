What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do
this?

git init creates a .git subdirectory, and probably initializes some files/data
structures there.  This sets up git's tracking information, and lets git know
that the directory is under git management.

How is the staging area different from the working dir and the repository?  
It is just a set of pointers to files in the directory; it is not a part of 
the repository---although that's not clear.  It is probably managed by the repo,
but whether it is considered in the repo or not could be argued.

So, if the work involves several logical changes, you can do them all at once in
your working directory, (and test to see that they are all OK), and then add files
to the staging area one logical set at at time, and do a commit for each set of 
adds.  Nice idea, but it won't work if changes for two logical issues are in a 
single file.  Staging area still seems like more of a complication than a good 
feature.
