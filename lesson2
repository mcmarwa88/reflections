What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do
this?

git init creates a .git subdirectory, and probably initializes some files/data
structures there.  This sets up git's tracking information, and lets git know
that the directory is under git management.

How is the staging area different from the working dir and the repository?  
It is just a set of pointers to files in the directory; it is not a part of 
the repository---although that's not clear.  It is probably managed by the repo,
but whether it is considered in the repo or not could be argued.
